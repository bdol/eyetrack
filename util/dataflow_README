These are the steps needed to get a raw data file into two cropped eye image
files that are transformed to the canonical coordinates.

1. In util/raw_processing, use the Matlab cell script "convert_raw_dir.m" to
export the raw data in the given root dir to .png data. For instance, if the
raw_data dir is in "~/Desktop/raw_data", set the "raw_dir" variable to
'~/Desktop/raw_data'. Then run the script.

2. Note: make sure you make a clean build of the specialized face tracker (in
util/face_rectification) before starting this step. In util/crop_eyes,
run the Python script gen_file_corresp.py with the following:

./gen_file_corresp <path_to_png_image_root> <path_to_out_coordinate_directory>

This will create a TSV file fileCorresp.txt that is of the following form:
<path_to_png_file> <path_to_mesh_coordinates>

Each mesh coordinate file contains the coordinates of a node on the face mesh
which was fitted with FaceTracker.
