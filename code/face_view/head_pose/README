// Desc        : Head pose program that detects the head pose of raw depth 
//               images and writes them to a file as specified.
//======================================================================

Watch out for:
Runs on raw depth images
edit src/main.cpp to specify file paths

Deps:
Opencv

Before you run:
In src/main.cpp, edit variables
output_file_path and input_file_path
output_file_path is the full path of the desired output file
input_file_path is the full path of the file containing a list of 'RAW' depth 
images

Compiling and Running: 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
../bin/head_pose

Potential Issues:
Compiling: If cmake cannot automatically determine the location of opencv, 
you would need to edit the CMakeLists.txt file to explicitly define the 
include and library locations.
Run 'ccmake ..' instead of 'cmake ..' to edit these values gui style
