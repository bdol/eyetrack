This test runs an N-fold cross validation using kernalized SVM (with several
different kernels including XXX, XXX, XXX). It uses the cropped eye set with
intensity features. In addition it IGNORES the first frame in every 3-frame
sequence (see load_cropped_eyes_intensity.m for the implementation), as the
participant was not always ready.

NOTE: strfind might have changed between MATLAB versions (the argument order
seems to be different). This test was authored using R2011b.
